Sure, here's an example of what a README file for a Go API might look like:

# My Go API

My Go API is a web application that provides a tax calculator.

## Installation

To install My Go API, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/.

Once you have Go installed, you can clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mailgagannow/go-assignment.git
```

## Usage

To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
go run main.go
